      <p>Remember <code>iddqd</code> and <code>idkfa</code>? Those are 
two strings were etched into my brain at a very young age where fond 
memories of playing shareware Doom live. For SenseCon ’19, Lauren and 
Reino joined me as we dove into some reversing of <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">chocolate-doom</a>
 with the aim of recreating similar cheats. The results? Well, a video 
of it is shown below. We managed to get cheats working that would:</p>



<ul><li>Increment your ammo instead of decrement it.</li><li>Increment everyone’s health for the amount it would have gone down for. Yes, you read right, everyone.</li><li>Toggle cheats just like how they behaved in classic doom.</li></ul>



<p>The source code for our cheats live <a href="https://github.com/sensepost/frida-windows-playground/blob/master/doom-cheats.js">here</a> if you want to play along, or maybe even contribute new ones :)</p>

<h2>The setup</h2>



<p>The original Doom game was released in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise)#Main_series">1993</a>, built for OSs a little different to what we have today. The <a href="https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom">chocolate-doom</a>
 project exists and aims to be as historically correct as possible while
 still working on modern operating systems. Perfect nostalgia. We 
downloaded chocolate-doom for Windows from <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/downloads/3.0.0/chocolate-doom-3.0.0-win32.zip">here</a>, extracted and sourced a <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DOOM1.WAD">shareware WAD</a> to use.</p>



<p>We also set some rules for our project. The chocolate-doom source 
code is available, however, we did not want to reference it at all.  
Once extracted, <code>chocolate-doom.exe</code> was a stripped PE32 
executable. This meant that reverse engineering efforts would be a 
little harder, but that was part of the challenge and learnings we 
wanted. Using tools such as <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml">IDA Freeware</a>, <a href="https://www.cheatengine.org/">CheatEngine</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">WindDBG</a>
 was considered fair game though. However, any patches or binary 
modifications had to be implemented using Frida, and not by manually 
patching <code>chocolate-doom.exe</code>.</p>



<h2>Finding where to start – Windows</h2>



<p>Sometimes, getting started is the hardest part. We decided to get a 
bit of a kick start by using CheatEngine to find interesting code paths 
based on the games UI.</p>



<p>First up was finding out what code was responsible for the  ammo 
count. CheatEngine is a memory  scanner and debugger that is 
particularly suited for this task. You can attach to a running process 
with CheatEngine, and scan the process’ memory to find all instances of a
 particular value. If our ammo count is  currently 49, we can search for
 all instances of the value 49 in memory. There may however be quite a 
number of instances of this value within the process’ memory – a scan 
will often return several. Additionally, not all instances will be 
related to the ammo count.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/201908165835_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28787"><figcaption>Searching for the value 49 returns several memory locations</figcaption></figure>



<p>To pinpoint exactly the right location, we can can change the value a
 bit, and then rescan using CheatEngine for any instances of the 
previously found value that was altered by the same amount. We could do 
this by shooting the handgun a few times and taking note of by how much 
the ammo count was changed. We can then use the “Next Scan” function and
 the  “Decreased value by” scan type option to search in CheatEngine for
 a value that has also changed by the same amount. This decreased the 
amount of possible locations for the ammo count to only three. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/201908170112_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28789"><figcaption>Only three possible locations found for the ammo count.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At this point all the possible instances could be either the 
original, or a copy of the original ammo count. We can watch these 
memory locations to determine which instructions write to them in an 
attempt to identify the code that is responsible for decreasing the 
ammo. To do this in CheatEngine, you can simply click right a watched 
memory location,  and select “Find out what writes to this address”.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/201908173156_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28801"><figcaption>Watching updates to a memory location.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When watching the first two locations we identified, we saw 
instructions rapidly writing to the target pointers even while the game 
was paused. These instructions also didn’t subtract from the ammo count 
which meant that these instructions were probably not what we were 
looking for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/201908173224_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28802"><figcaption>A rapid firing instruction on the watched memory location.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The third match we had saw writes only when the handgun was fired. 
The instruction was a subtraction by one and therefore likely the 
instruction to decrease the ammo count we are interested in. CheatEngine
 allows you to disassemble code around the identified instruction. Using
 this, we had the location of the instruction responsible for decreasing
 the ammo count when the handgun was shot at <code>0x0430A2c</code>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-06_at_11_55_21-1024x635.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28599"><figcaption>Instruction to reduce the handgun’s ammo by 1</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Finding where to start – Linux</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">While not the primary target for our 
project, we also had a go at patching the chocolate-doom ELF binary. 
This was all done on an Ubuntu machine using similar tools as mentioned 
above, however, cheat engine was not available for Linux. Instead, to 
start finding interesting code paths in the ELF binary, we used a tool 
called <a href="https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem">scanmem </a>which is
 similar to CheatEngine, but only gives the addresses of a value in 
memory and not which instruction alters it. After starting up scanmem 
and entering the changing ammo value a couple of times, it also isolated
 3 possible addresses for ammo. These would change at each invocation of
 chocolate-doom because of the use of ASLR.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/scanmem-ammo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28909"><figcaption>Scanmem showing the addresses storing the current ammo value.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To find out what instructions write to the identified pointers, we used <code>gdb</code> and set a watchpoint on each address found by scanmem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/gdb-watchpoints-ammo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28912"><figcaption>Watch points set for the ammo decrease.</figcaption></figure>



<p>We then continued the game and shot once with the handgun to trigger a watchpoint. You can see the old and new ammo value below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/gdb-watch-point-triggered.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28913"><figcaption>Watchpoint triggered after shooting with the handgun.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Next was to check where the instruction pointer was and to view the 
instructions surrounding it to see if we could spot the exact 
instruction that subtracts one from the ammo value each time a shot is 
fired.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/gdb-ammo-examine-instructions.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28914"><figcaption>rip and the surrounding instructions</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you can see, there is a <code>sub</code> instruction just before 
where the instruction pointer is currently sitting. To search for the 
exact instruction in IDA, we viewed the hex value of the instruction in 
gdb. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/gdb-hex-of-instructions.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28915"><figcaption>Viewing the sub instruction in hex</figcaption></figure>



<p>Because the below values are little endian, we searched for the opcodes <code>83 ac 83 a8</code>
 in IDA and had the offset location of the instruction responsible for 
decreasing the ammo count when the handgun was shot, i.e. <code>0x49F28</code>.</p>



<h2>Watching functions with Frida</h2>



<p>With some target offsets at hand, we could start to watch them in real time with Frida. Frida has an <a href="https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#interceptor">Interceptor API</a>,
 that allows you to “intercept” function calls and execute code as a 
function prolog or epilog. One also has access to the arguments and the 
return value using the <code>Interceptor</code>, making it possible to log and if needed, change these values.</p>



<p>Given that we know which instructions were writing to memory regions 
that contained the ammo value for our handgun, we used IDA to analyse 
the function around the instruction to find the entry point for it. This
 way we would know which memory address to use with the Interceptor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-07_at_08_25_37-1024x984.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28624"><figcaption>Entrypoint into the function that affected the handgun’s ammo</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, the function starts at <code>0x4309f0</code>. With a base of <code>0x400000</code> that means that the function’s offset is just <code>0x309f0 </code>from
 that (this will be important later). With a known offset, our first 
Frida script started. This script would simply find the <code>chocolate-doom</code> module’s base address, calculate the offset to the function we are interested in and attach the Interceptor. The Interceptor <code>onEnter</code> callback would then simply log that the function triggered.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot-2019-05-07-at-09.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28629"><figcaption>Interceptor attached to the hangun fire function’s entry point</figcaption></figure>



<p>We can see this script in action when attached to chocolate-doom below.</p>

<p>Knowing that function triggers as we fire the handgun helps confirm that we are on the right track. </p>



<h2>Our first cheat</h2>



<p>We figured we would start by writing a simple patch that just replaces the instruction to decrement the ammo count by 1 with <code>NOP</code> instructions. Frida has a <a href="https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#x86writer">Code writer</a> module that can help with this. The original decrement instruction was <code>sub dword ptr [ebx+edx*4+0A4h], 1</code> which is represented as 8 opcodes when viewed in hex.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot-2019-05-07-at-10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28634"><figcaption>Hex opcodes for the instruction decrementing ammo of the handgun</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code writer could be used to patch <code>0x430a2c</code> with exactly 8 <code>NOP</code> instructions using the <code>putNopPadding(8)</code> method on a code writer instance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-07_at_10_44_19-1024x634.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28635"><figcaption>Frida code writer used to replace the ammo decrementing instructions with 8 NOPs.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Applying this patch meant that we no longer ran out of ammo with the handgun.</p>



<iframe src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/rlAxOR-GFS0.html" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<h2>Improving the first ammo cheat</h2>



<p>To test how effective our <code>NOP</code>-based cheat was, we used 
one of the original cheats (“idkfa”) to get all of the available guns 
and ammo and see if it worked for those as well. Turns out, it didn’t, 
and some investigation revealed that each gun had its own ammo 
decrementing function. All functions eventually called an opcode that 
would <code>SUB</code> <code>0x1</code> from an ammo total (except for the machine gun that would <code>SUB</code> <code>0x2</code>).  An improvement was necessary.</p>



<p>We didn’t want to hardcode all of the instructions we found and looked for other options. When searching in IDA for the opcodes <code>0x83 0xac</code> (part of the ammo <code>SUB</code> opcodes for <code>sub dword ptr [ebx+edx*4+0A4h], 1</code>),
 we noticed that the only matches were those that formed part of 
functions that decremented ammo. Frida has a memory scanner that we 
could use to match the locations of these functions that we were 
interested in dynamically (as <code>0x83 0xac</code>), available as <code>Memory.scanSync()</code>. We then used the same <code>Memory.patchCode()</code> function to simply override the opcodes to <code>ADD</code> instead of  <code>SUB</code> as a simple two-byte patch :)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-07_at_12_55_20-1024x664.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28653"><figcaption>Ammo patcher to increment instead of decrement ammo for each matched opcode search</figcaption></figure>



<p>This patch was a little more generic and did not require any 
hardcoded offsets to work. Depending on what you are working with, a 
better search may be to use some of the wildcarding features of <code>Memory.scanSync()</code> so that you can have much more specific matches.</p>



<p>With our patch applied, all weapons now incremented their ammo count as you fired.</p>

<h2>Writing a health cheat</h2>



<p>After fiddling with ammo related routines, we changed our focus to 
health.  We used the same CheatEngine technique as before to figure out 
where our health was being stored and who was writing to those 
locations. Finding the health locations however turned out to be a bit 
more tricky, as around four to five different locations would appear 
between different searches. Some of these locations had rapid firing 
instructions executing writes on them, as before with the ammo count, 
and were thus ignored. Around three locations had instructions which 
triggered when the player’s health decreased.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/201908175925_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28814"><figcaption>The locations for the player’s health.</figcaption></figure>



<p> The instructions were however not sub instructions, but rather mov 
instructions. Looking at the disassembled code, we could however spot 
the <code>sub</code> instruction a few lines higher up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/201908182618_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28819"><figcaption>One
 of the set of instructions that triggered when a player’s health 
decreased. Note the sub instruction above the mov instruction, that did 
the actual subtraction.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What is important to note is that instruction was a subtraction between two registers, i.e. <code>sub eax, esi</code>.
 This is a fairly common instruction, and meant that we can’t just scan 
for all instances of it in memory and replace it with an <code>add</code> instruction like we did with the ammo increment patch. Instead, we manually went to the location of each of the <code>sub</code> instructions, and changed it to an <code>add</code> instruction. When viewed as opcodes, <code>sub eax, esi</code> is <code>0x29 0xF0</code>, while <code>add eax, esi</code> is <code>0x01 0xF0</code>. So, a patch was simply a case of swapping out the <code>0x29</code> for a <code>0x01</code>. The <code>sub</code> instructions for the three different functions were at <code>0x3DEEC</code>, <code>0x2C385</code>, and <code>0x2c39</code>. </p>



<p>Patching <code>0x3DEEC</code> however often caused the game to crash, so it was removed later on. Patching <code>0x2C385</code>, and especially <code>0x2c39</code>
 made the player’s health increase when attacked. It however also has 
the side effect of making all monster’s health increase as well when 
they are attacked – this might be because both the player and monsters 
in the game use the same logic for health deduction. ¯\_(?)_/¯</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-08_at_11_50_14-1024x738.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28712"><figcaption>Health patch to ADD instead of SUB</figcaption></figure>



<p>With this patch applied, the incrementing health cheat could be seen in the following video.</p>

<h2>Making our patches, cheats – static analysis</h2>



<p>Up to now we have been patching chocolate-doom for our cheats as soon
 as Frida was injected and our scripts were run. We really wanted to 
make our cheats behave like the originals did by simply typing them in 
the game, “iddqd” and “idkfa” style.</p>



<p>To implement this the chocolate-doom binary was analysed to find the 
logic that handles the current cheats. We knew that if you typed 
“idkfa”, the game would pop up a message saying “VERY HAPPY AMMO ADDED”.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-08_at_12_02_54-1024x770.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28713"><figcaption>Message after using the idkfa cheat</figcaption></figure>



<p>A text search in IDA for this message revealed the location where it was used.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-08_at_12_05_44-1024x462.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28714"><figcaption>Very Happy Ammo Added search in IDA</figcaption></figure>



<p>We focussed on the function this reference was in and realised that 
it was an incredibly long function. In fact, it appeared as though all 
of the cheats were processed by this single function, with a bunch of 
branches for each cheat. Code paths could be seen in the IDA graph view 
and gave us a reasonable idea of its complexity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-08_at_12_11_19-1024x446.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28715"><figcaption>IDA graph view of the cheat function</figcaption></figure>



<p>All of the different cheats branches also made a call to a function that lived at <code>0x040FE90</code>.
 This function took two arguments, one being a character array and 
another an integer and appeared to be comparing a character to a string.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-08_at_12_19_20-1024x987.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28717"><figcaption>Comparison function called for each cheat in the previous routine.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="mce_65">Making our patches, cheats – dynamic analysis</h2>



<p>We decided to have a look at the invocation of this cheat comparison function (henceforth called <code>cheat_compare</code>) at runtime, dumping the arguments it receives. Just like we have previously used the Frida <code>Interceptor</code> to attach to a function, we simply calculate the offset for <code>cheat_compare</code>
 and log the arguments it receives. This will also give us an 
opportunity to try and discover how to trigger this function in game.</p>



<p>From IDA we knew the first argument was a character array, so we just dumped the raw string using the <code>readCString()</code> Frida method for that. For the second argument we weren’t entirely sure what that would have been, and left it raw for now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot_2019-05-08_at_12_26_31-1024x396.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28718"><figcaption>Argument dumping using the Frida Interceptor for cheat_compare</figcaption></figure>



<p>With this script hooked, the results were rather… surprising…</p>



<iframe src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/AJq1fgaBInk.html" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p>Every keypress the game received appeared to enter the identified compare function we called <code>cheat_compare</code>.
 Even arrow keys! In the video demo above, we slowly entered the cheat 
“iddqd”, where you can see many of the possible cheats Doom has being 
compared to the hex value of the ASCII character we entered. Once the 
cheat matched, we moved Doom guy left a few times using an arrow key, 
which is where values such as <code>0xffffffac</code> entered the 
routine for a bunch of possible cheats too. Without understanding the 
full cheat routine, we were sure these would never match something 
legitimate, so we suspected we may have found an optimisation 
opportunity here :)</p>



<h2 id="mce_66">Making our patches, cheats – implementation</h2>



<p>The two arguments <code>cheat_compare</code> was receiving was enough
 for us to start building our own implementation. In fact, receiving the
 keycodes entered was all we needed. We could have gone and tried to 
patch the original routine to match some new strings and trigger our 
patches, but instead we chose an easier way out. We can read the 
keycodes that <code>cheat_compare</code> received, perform some tests for our cheats and then let the original function continue as normal.</p>



<p>Herein lies an important concept I suspect many don’t immediately 
realise when using Frida. While Frida is a fantastic runtime 
instrumentation library, it can also be used to easily execute some 
JavaScript logic from within any function. In other words, we can 
introduce and execute code that was *not* part of the original binary, 
from within that binary. We don’t have to patch some code to jump to 
opcodes we have wrote, no, we can just execute pure JavaScript.</p>



<p>The <code>cheat_compare</code> method, admittedly, was a little 
confusing. We decided to use the keycode we got as an argument, but had 
to work around the fact that we would receive the same keycode a number 
of times as the method was repeatedly called for different cheats with 
the same keycode. As a result, we decided on simply recording unique 
keycodes . This introduced only one limitation; our cheats couldn’t have
 repeating characters. The result was a method that would check a 
character and append it if it was unique, returning the full recorded 
buffer if a new character was added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot-2019-05-08-at-13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28720"><figcaption>Method used to record keycodes received in cheat_compare()</figcaption></figure>



<p>Next, we attached to <code>cheat_compare</code> and fired this new <code>getCheatFromBufWithChar()</code>
 to get the buffer of characters that were entered thus far. If a buffer
 ended with one of our strings, we fired the relevant patch to activate 
the cheat! To optimise the routine a little, we exited early if the 
entered keycode was not in the ASCII printable range.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="SensePost%20|%20Hacking%20doom%20for%20fun,%20health%20and%20ammo_files/Screenshot-2019-05-08-at-13_002.png" alt="" class="wp-image-28721"><figcaption>cheat_compare entrypoint used to match new, custom cheats</figcaption></figure>



<p>The result of this script meant that any unique ascii characters that
 were read would be compared to toggle the status of a cheat. This also 
meant that we had to write smaller routines that would undo the patches 
we wrote, but those were relatively easy as we already knew the offsets 
and original opcodes.</p>

<p>The final script to play with these cheats is available <a href="https://github.com/sensepost/frida-windows-playground/blob/master/doom-cheats.js">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>While choosing Doom may have been an easy target, we learnt a lot and
 got to play games while at it! We hope this inspires you to dig a 
little deeper into Frida and experiment more with it.</p>
